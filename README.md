# Batch & Stream Processing Exploration
## Technologies Explored
- **Ingestion**: Kafka, Flume.
- **Stream Processing**: Spark Streaming, Storm, Flink.
- **Batch Processing**: MapReduce, Spark, Pig, Hive.
- **Workflow**: Oozie
- **Storage**: HBase, MongoDB, Cassandra, MySQL.
## Highlights
- **Batch Processing**: Analyzed movie rating data with MapReduce, Spark, Pig and Hive on top of Hadoop, as well as with Spark on top of Cassandra and MongoDB.
- **Workflow**: Setup a Oozie workflow that imports data from MySQL into HDFS through Sqoop, and then processes the data with Hive.
- **Stream Processing**: Analyzed web logs published through Flume using Spark Streaming. Aggregated word counts with Storm and Flink.
